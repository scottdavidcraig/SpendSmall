                        <p>After leaving India for the UK in 1983,  Atul Pathak has become one of this country’s most successful restaurant-franchise entrepreneurs. He runs a chain of McDonalds franchises across north-west London, through his company Appt Corporation. He opened his first restaurant in 2003 - and now employs over 1,600 staff. </p><p>Appt Corporation trains recognised qualifications equivalent to GCSEs and A-levels, as well as certificates in adult literacy and numeracy. Atul is personally involved with community and charity groups, including children’s charities that provide free family accommodation at hospitals across the UK.</p>
                        <h4>Apart from your own hard work, what was it about the UK that allowed you to thrive here? Do those conditions remain?</h4>
                      <p>It was clear from the start that the UK was a fairer society than other places where I had previously worked. There was greater equality of opportunity, something that has improved still further. Someone can succeed here if they work hard with honesty and integrity. London in particular has always been a place that has attracted people who want to better themselves and I am grateful for the chances that opened up for me and that I was able to grab.</p>
                        <h4>What would you say is your single greatest contribution to the UK so far?
</h4>
                        <p>I could just think of my tax payments as a significant contribution! But really I am most proud of developing the people that I have worked with. They started at the bottom, as I did. Many have made great strides in their careers whilst working with me. They bought their own home, sent their children to excellent schools and have become good citizens. My employees quickly understand the importance and value of honesty, integrity and hard work. 
</p>
                        
                        <h4>What will be your legacy to the UK? (Meaning what will you leave behind)

</h4>
                        <p>I am immensely proud of being an Indian but the UK is my home and the place where I have raised my children. I am committed to making as much of a contribution as possible to those communities that my restaurants serve. Creating links between the UK and India will help others that wish to follow the same path as me as well as UK companies who are aiming to invest in the rapidly expanding Indian economy. I hope that I can also play a part as a role model for young entrepreneurs and people considering starting their own business. Anything is possible with the right mind and dedication.

</p>
                         <h4>Would you be willing to share some hard numbers relating to your economic contribution e.g. number of employees, annual turnover, units sold - perhaps even a tax bill!

</h4>
                        <p>Ten years ago I opened my first McDonald’s restaurant in Hanwell. Today I operate twenty McDonald’s restaurants in West and Northwest London, with a turnover of over £35m. My 1,600 employees served over 10.8 million customers last year.

                        <h4>Philanthropy: there are many ways to "give back" to the community, such as personal foundations or financial contributions. Please tell us about your acts of philanthropy, big and small.


</h4>
                        <p>We have supported Ronald McDonald House Charities (RMHC) since 2006.
The organisation works with more than forty hospital trusts and hospices across the UK to provide free ‘home from home’ accommodation so that sick children can have their families nearby.<br>
We also sponsor up-and-coming local talent in grassroots football. It encourages younger people off the street and into something they enjoy. It’s physical activity and it develops skills that are attractive to employers, such as teamwork. <br><br>
This year, I have launched the Appt Corporation Community Awards to support smaller charities and community groups in and around London, especially those working at grass roots. The Awards aim to highlight and celebrate the work that community groups do in their local areas, and of course to help them financially.

<p>Perween began her business after emigrating here from India in the 1970s. S&A was a kitchen table start-up, with Perween making samosas on an initial investment of £2.50. She now has a reported net worth of £70m and is one of Britain's highest-profile Asian female entrepreneurs.
                      
                        <h4>What was it about the UK that allowed your hard work to pay off? Do those conditions remain?
</h4>
                      <p>The UK was - and still is - a land of opportunity, a place where determined entrepreneurs can explore and experiment.</p><p>

Particularly, when I moved here in 1975, I found a widespread appreciation for ideas, honesty and commitment. When I first began to win orders from my customers I was still cooking from home, but I never hid that from them. And when I committed to hiring our first business premises, the British people around me saw I was taking a risk and they valued it. Customers, local authorities, staff, suppliers – they all helped me along and I’m so grateful. If you work hard, remain open and remain approachable, people will accept you and help you.
</p>
                        <h4> How would you describe your contribution to the UK?
</h4>
                        <p>Not altering the DNA of our foods. Our food is authentic - that’s my biggest contribution. British food was so different in the 1970s. Back then I remember going to a posh house for dinner and being quite shocked that the host served boiled vegetables. We couldn’t imagine doing  that in India! But now, people are so much more adventurous in their cuisine.<br><br>
 
Just as importantly, S&A Foods employs up to 500 people and contributes to 1000s of other jobs in the supply chain.<br><br>
 
Of course, an immigrant’s contribution can be about more than numbers. I always say that I enjoy “making the inaccessible accessible”. I don’t just mean Indian cuisine – I mean encouraging women from ethnic minorities into the workplace. The very first two people I hired were women who didn’t speak English at all. They went on to inspire others in the community to find work too, some of them women who had never worked in their lives, because they’d never been given the opportunity.<br><br>
 
We hire anyone who is committed, hardworking and loyal – we hire Derby natives and immigrants alike. We hire for attitude and train for skills: it doesn’t matter to us where people are from. There are 27 languages spoken under our factory roof. I hear Thai accents, Jamaican accents, everyone.<br><br>
 
We have several full-time trainers who work on the factory floor helping our staff to learn business English – we train the majority to NVQ2 level, and we find our staff are very willing to learn English and generally adapt.<br><br>

</p>
                        
                        <h4>You’ve given a lot back to the people of Derby in terms of jobs, but what about traditional philanthropy?


</h4>
                        <p>I support children’s charities. Giving a child an education is like lighting a candle to see the world. the best way to eliminate poverty.<br><br>
 
I also support charities providing free healthcare for disadvantaged people, and I’m about to start working with Woman’s Aid (Womensaid.org.uk), a national UK charity that works to end domestic violence against women and children.<br><br>

</p>
                         <h4>Imagine it’s 2014, you're 21, Indian and you can’t find work. Would you want to emigrate to the UK – or elsewhere?


</h4>
                        <p> Yes. The UK remains a liberal place, one in which migrants should be proud to live and take an active part. For people who are willing to work hard and want to succeed, it is a great country.

In 1991 he founded Paladin Associates to invest in a range of food businesses, which included Caffé Nero, which at the time was operating from five locations. It now employs more than 4,000 people and operates 600 stores globally, opening one new store a week.</p>

                        <h4>What was it about the UK that allowed your hard work to pay off? Do those conditions remain?
</h4>
                      <p>The United Kingdom is a place that has orderly rules and regulations. Generally, you can understand how the system works and there is not excessive red tape to hold an entrepreneur back. There is much more to do to improve the environment to encourage individuals to start and to grow businesses, but the UK is still one of the easiest places in Europe from which to operate.
</p>
                        <h4>What would you say is your single greatest contribution to the UK?

</h4>
                        <p>Our single greatest contribution is the creation of more than 4,000 jobs in the UK and this is growing by approximately 350 new jobs a year. These individuals, in turn, are reaching out in their communities throughout the UK (we have a presence in more than 230 towns and cities) seeking to make a positive difference in their immediate surroundings. And we serve more than 55 million people a year too. I believe we make a positive contribution to those we serve and in the places where we operate.

</p>
                        
                        <h4>Would you be willing to share some hard-to-come-by numbers relating to your economic contribution e.g. number of employees, annual turnover, units sold?  


</h4>
                        <p>Those 4,000 employees. Plus we own and operate more than 560 stores in the UK.  Our revenue is approximately £230 million per annum. We sell more than 58 million coffees per annum.

</h4>
                        <p> We are a privately held company and we have created a Foundation to give back to the communities where we operate. We take on special projects which benefit these communities and have a link or a personal connection to our employees. Specifically, employees are encouraged each year to fundraise in their local communities for charities that matter to them.  We give them the licence to chose the projects, and they use their cafés to host events.  In turn the Nero Foundation matches the funds raised by these initiatives.  We also support Project Waterfall, which provides clean water for coffee growing communities in Africa.



</p>
                        <h4>What values and customs from your home country can be seen in Caffe Nero?



</h4>
                        <p>I’d say meritocracy, flat hierarchy, an organisational structure that is more family values than corporate and an acceptance of a wide range of individuals whereby people are valued. A casual environment alongside a commitment to work hard and being passionate about what we do. We have also spread ownership among employees (who own 10% of the company). I am from Silicon Valley and this is an approach used there.</p>

                        <p>Born in Punjab, Surinder Arora arrived in this country in 1972 aged 13 and unable to speak any English. At 18, he was a junior clerk at British Airways. Now 54, he is one of the UK’s most successful hoteliers, with a personal fortune estimated at £356m. He operates 16 hotels under various brands, including Arora, Hilton, Radisson and Sofitel. His first break came in property, financed with savings earned from cleaning floors - in a hotel that he now owns.
</p>
                        <h4>What was it about the UK that enabled your hard work to pay off? Do those conditions remain?
</h4>
                      <p>In some parts of the world things are done the old way, where it’s all about who you know, not what you know. It’s a shame. Those countries and economies get left behind. In the UK things are so much more positive. There is a level playing field – I was lucky my parents came here. </p>
                        <h4> Young people in the U.K are increasingly aware of entrepreneurship, but at the same time many other young people no longer wish to do the ordinary jobs you did on the way up. 
</h4>
                        <p>I am very proud of my work history. I tell all my staff, or any youngsters I meet: “Look, I used to work as a waiter. I used to clean the floors. It’s something I’m proud of, not ashamed of.” My dear mum would do a day job in a factory, come home and cook for the family, then leave again to clean offices in Southall. I was lucky to have her as a role model, and it’s something I told my kids. They worked in the local supermarket. 
</p>
                        <h4>What would you say is your single greatest contribution to the U.K.? 
</h4>
                        <p>I employ over 2000 people, of all nationalities. And I let my managers know they should employ disabled staff, and not because they are disabled; if my one of managers thinks a disabled person is right person for the job then it doesn't matter if it takes us three times as long to train them. My staff are like family, and the loyalty I get from them is very satisfying. Money can’t buy that feeling.
</p>
                        
                        <h4>Do you believe in philanthropy? 
</h4>
                        
                        <p>Yes, in various ways. Just recently I helped out people made homeless in the floods of February 2014, in Windsor, Maidenhead and Runnymede. I made one of my hotels available to them for a few days for no charge, food too. I also make my hotels available for charity balls in aid of cancer research, where revenue is raised from selling tables and all of it goes to the charity. One event recently we divided the money between Marie Curie and the Caron Keating Charity. We raised just under half a million pounds from one evening. We’re doing more of those – my dear wife was touched by a charity in India working in aid of victims of child trafficking, and I also support the Evelina Children’s Hospital in London.
